### Story Line:
Naveen is a filmmaker who has delivered double-hattrick blockbusters. He thinks to attempt a different film and unites with his friend Venkata Ramana. During this process, he comes across a video of Alekhya an ophthalmologist. Pretty impressed by her charm and performance, he thinks to cast her as his film heroine. Alekhya and her family hate films to the core. But desperate Naveen keeps trying to convince her.
